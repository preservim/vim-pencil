# Features

The _pencil_ plugin aspires to make Vim as powerful a tool for writers as
it is for coders by focusing narrowly on the handful of tweaks needed to
smooth the path to writing prose.

* For editing prose-oriented file types such as _text_, _markdown_,
  _mail_, _rst_, _tex_, _textile_, and _asciidoc_
* Agnostic on soft line wrap _versus_ hard line breaks, supporting both
* Auto-detects wrap mode via `modeline` and sampling
* Adjusts navigation key mappings to suit the wrap mode
* Creates undo points on common punctuation during Insert mode, including
  deletion via line `<C-U>` and word `<C-W>`
* Buffer-scoped configuration (with a few minor exceptions, _pencil_ preserves
  your global settings)
* Support for Vim’s Conceal feature to hide markup defined by Syntax plugins
  (e.g., `_` and `*` markup for styled text in \_*Markdown*\_)
* Support for display of mode indicator (`␍` and `⤸`, e.g.) in the status line
* Pure Vimscript with no dependencies

In addition, when using hard line break mode:

* Makes use of Vim’s powerful autoformat while inserting text, except for
  tables and code blocks where you won’t want it.
* *NEW* Optional key mapping to suspend autoformat for the Insert.

Need spell-check, distraction-free editing, and other features? Vim is about
customization. To complete your editing environment, learn to configure Vim and
draw upon its rich ecosystem of plugins.

# Why use Vim for writing?

With plenty of word processing applications available, including those
that specifically cater to writers, why use a modal editor like Vim?
Several reasons have been offered:

* Your hands can rest in a neutral ‘home’ position, only rarely straying
  to reach for mouse, track pad, or arrow keys
* Minimal chording, with many mnemonic-friendly commands
* Sophisticated capabilities for navigating and manipulating text
* Highly configurable, enabling you to build a workflow that suits your
  needs, with many great plugins available
* No proprietary format lock-in

But while such reasons might be sound, they remain scant justification to
switch away from the familiar word processor. Instead, you need
a compelling reason—one that can appeal to a writer’s love for language
and the tools of writing.

You can find that reason in Vim’s mysterious command sequences. Take `cas`
for instance. You might see it as a mnemonic for _Change Around Sentence_
to replace an existing sentence. But dig a bit deeper to discover that
such commands have a grammar of their own, comprised of nouns, verbs, and
modifiers. Think of them as the composable building blocks of a _domain
specific language_ for manipulating text, one that can become a powerful
tool in expressing yourself. For more details on vi-style editing, see...

# Installation

_pencil_ is best installed using a Vim package manager, such as
[Vundle][vnd], [Plug][plg], [NeoBundle][nbn], or [Pathogen][pth].

_For those new to Vim: before installing this plugin, consider getting
comfortable with the basics of Vim by working through one of the many
tutorials available._

[vnd]: https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim
[plg]: https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug
[nbn]: https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim
[pth]: https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen

# Configuration

## Initializing by command

You can manually enable, disable, and toggle _pencil_ as a command:

* `Pencil` - initialize _pencil_ with auto-detect for the current buffer
* `NoPencil` (or `PencilOff`) - removes navigation mappings and restores buffer to global settings
* `TogglePencil` (or `PencilToggle`) - if on, turns off; if off, initializes with auto-detect

Because auto-detect might not work as intended, you can invoke a command
to set the behavior for the current buffer:

* `SoftPencil` (or `PencilSoft`) - initialize _pencil_ with soft line wrap mode
* `HardPencil` (or `PencilHard`) - initialize _pencil_ with hard line break mode (and Vim’s autoformat)

## Initializing by file type

Initializing _pencil_ by file type is _optional_, though doing so will
automatically set up your buffers for editing prose.

Add support for your desired file types to your `.vimrc`:

```vim
set nocompatible
filetype plugin on       " may already be in your .vimrc

augroup pencil
  autocmd!
  autocmd FileType markdown,mkd call pencil#init()
  autocmd FileType text         call pencil#init()
augroup END
```

You can initialize several prose-oriented plugins together:

```vim
augroup pencil
  autocmd!
  autocmd FileType markdown,mkd call pencil#init()
                            \ | call lexical#init()
                            \ | call litecorrect#init()
                            \ | call textobj#quote#init()
                            \ | call textobj#sentence#init()
augroup END
```

For a list of other prose-oriented plugins, consult the [See
also](#see-also) section below.

## Hard line breaks or soft line wrap?

Coders will have the most experience with the former, and writers the
latter. But whatever your background, chances are that you must contend
with both conventions. This plugin doesn’t force you to choose a side—you
can configure each buffer independently.

In most cases you can set a default to suit your preference and let
auto-detection figure out what to do.

```vim
let g:pencil#wrapModeDefault = 'soft'   " default is 'hard'

augroup pencil
  autocmd!
  autocmd FileType markdown,mkd call pencil#init()
  autocmd FileType text         call pencil#init({'wrap': 'hard'})
augroup END
```

In the example above, for buffers of type `markdown` this plugin will
auto-detect the line wrap approach, with soft line wrap as the default.

For buffers of type `text`, it will initialize with hard line breaks,
even if auto-detect might suggest soft line wrap.

## Automatic formatting

_The ‘autoformat’ feature affects `HardPencil` (hard line break) mode
only._

When inserting text while in `HardPencil` mode, Vim’s powerful autoformat
feature will be _enabled_ by default and can offer many of the same
benefits as soft line wrap.

To set the default behavior in your `.vimrc`:

```vim
let g:pencil#autoformat = 1      " 0=disable, 1=enable (def)
```

You can override this default during initialization, as in:

```vim
augroup pencil
  autocmd!
  autocmd FileType markdown call pencil#init({'wrap': 'hard', 'autoformat': 1})
  autocmd FileType text     call pencil#init({'wrap': 'hard', 'autoformat': 0})
  ...
augroup END
```

...where buffers of type `markdown` and `text` will use hard line breaks,
but `text` buffers will have autoformat disabled.

## Suspend automatic formatting for the Insert

There are two useful exceptions where autoformat (when enabled for the
buffer) will be _temporarily disabled_ for the current Insert:

**First** is _pencil’s_ ‘blacklisting’ feature: if used with popular
prose-oriented syntax plugins, _pencil_ will suspend autoformat when you
enter Insert mode from inside a code block or table.

**Second**, where blacklisting falls short, you can optionally map
a buffer-scoped ‘modifier’ key to suspend autoformat during the next
Insert:

```vim
let g:pencil#map#suspend_af = 'K'   " default is no mapping
```

Using the above mapping, with `Ko` you’ll enter Insert mode with the
cursor on a new line, but autoformat will suspend for that Insert. Using
`o` by itself will retain autoformat.

By default no modifier key is mapped.

(See the advanced section below for details on how blacklisting is
implemented and configured).

## Manual formatting

Note that you need not rely on Vim’s autoformat exclusively and can
manually reformat paragraphs with standard Vim commands:

* `gqap` - format current paragraph (see `:help gq` for details)
* `vapJgqap` - merge two paragraphs (current and next) and format
* `ggVGgq` or `:g/^/norm gqq` - format all paragraphs in buffer

Optionally, you can map these operations to underutilized keys in your
`.vimrc`:

```vim
nnoremap <silent> Q gqap
xnoremap <silent> Q gq
nnoremap <silent> <leader>Q vapJgqap
```

Or you may wish to ‘unformat’, (i.e., remove hard line breaks) when using
soft line wrap.

* `vipJ` - join all lines in current paragraph
* `:%norm vipJ` - unformat all paragraphs in buffer

## Default textwidth

You can configure the textwidth to be used in `HardPencil` (hard line
break) mode when no textwidth is set globally, locally, or available via
modeline. It defaults to `74`, but you can change that value in your
`.vimrc`:

```vim
let g:pencil#textwidth = 74
```

## Sentence spacing

By default, when formatting text (through `gwip`, e.g.) only one space
will be inserted after a period(`.`), exclamation point(`!`), or question
mark(`?`). You can change this default:

```vim
let g:pencil#joinspaces = 0     " 0=one_space (def), 1=two_spaces
```

## Cursor wrap

By default, `h`/`l` and the left/right cursor keys will move to the
previous/next line after reaching first/last character in a line with
a hard break. If you wish to retain the default Vim behavior, set the
`cursorwrap` value to `0` in your `.vimrc`:

```vim
let g:pencil#cursorwrap = 1     " 0=disable, 1=enable (def)
```

## Concealing \_\_markup\_\_

_pencil_ enables Vim’s powerful Conceal feature, although support among
Syntax and Colorscheme plugins is currently spotty.

You can change _pencil’s_ default settings for conceal in your `.vimrc`:

```vim
let g:pencil#conceallevel = 3     " 0=disable, 1=one char, 2=hide char, 3=hide all (def)
let g:pencil#concealcursor = 'c'  " n=normal, v=visual, i=insert, c=command (def)
```

For more details on Vim’s Conceal feature, see:

```vim
:help conceallevel
:help concealcursor
```

### Concealing styled text in Markdown

Syntax plugins such as [tpope/vim-markdown][tm] support concealing the
markup characters when displaying \_*italic*\_, \*\*__bold__\*\*, and
\*\*\*___bold italic___\*\*\* styled text.

To use Vim’s Conceal feature with Markdown, you will need to install:

1. [tpope/vim-markdown][tm] as it’s currently the only Markdown syntax
   plugin that supports conceal.

2. A monospaced font (such as [Cousine][co]) featuring the _italic_,
   **bold**, and ***bold italic*** style variant for styled text.

3. A colorscheme (such as [reedes/vim-colors-pencil][cp]) which supports
   the Markdown-specific highlight groups for styled text.

You should then only see the `_` and `*` markup for the cursor line and in
visual selections.

**Terminal users:** consult your terminal’s documentation to configure your
terminal to support **bold** and _italic_ styles.

## Status line indicator

Your status line can reflect the wrap mode for _pencil_ buffers. For
example, `␍` to represent `HardPencil` (hard line break) mode.  To
configure your status line and ruler, add to your `.vimrc`:

```vim
set statusline=%<%f\ %h%m%r%w\ \ %{PencilMode()}\ %=\ col\ %c%V\ \ line\ %l\,%L\ %P
set rulerformat=%-12.(%l,%c%V%)%{PencilMode()}\ %P
```

or if using [bling/vim-airline][va]:

```vim
let g:airline_section_x = '%{PencilMode()}'
```

The default indicators now include ‘auto’ for when Vim’s autoformat is
active in hard line break mode. (If autoformat is suspended for the
Insert, it’ll show the ‘hard’ indicator.)

```vim
let g:pencil#mode_indicators = {'hard': 'H', 'auto': 'A', 'soft': 'S', 'off': '',}
```

If Unicode is detected, the default indicators are:

```vim
let g:pencil#mode_indicators = {'hard': '␍', 'auto': 'ª', 'soft': '⤸', 'off': '',}
```

If you don’t like the default indicators, you can specify your own in
your `.vimrc`.

Note that `PencilMode()` will return blank for buffers in which _pencil_
has not been initialized.

## Advanced pencil

### Advanced initialization

You may want to refactor initialization statements into a function in
your `.vimrc` to set up a buffer for writing:

```vim
function! Prose()
  call pencil#init()
  call lexical#init()
  call litecorrect#init()
  call textobj#quote#init()
  call textobj#sentence#init()

  " manual reformatting shortcuts
  nnoremap <buffer> <silent> Q gqap
  xnoremap <buffer> <silent> Q gq
  nnoremap <buffer> <silent> <leader>Q vapJgqap

  " force top correction on most recent misspelling
  nnoremap <buffer> <c-s> [s1z=<c-o>
  inoremap <buffer> <c-s> <c-g>u<Esc>[s1z=`]A<c-g>u

  " replace common punctuation
  iabbrev <buffer> -- –
  iabbrev <buffer> --- —
  iabbrev <buffer> << «
  iabbrev <buffer> >> »

  " open most folds
  setlocal foldlevel=6

  " replace typographical quotes (reedes/vim-textobj-quote)
  map <silent> <buffer> <leader>qc <Plug>ReplaceWithCurly
  map <silent> <buffer> <leader>qs <Plug>ReplaceWithStraight

  " highlight words (reedes/vim-wordy)
  noremap <silent> <buffer> <F8> :<C-u>NextWordy<cr>
  xnoremap <silent> <buffer> <F8> :<C-u>NextWordy<cr>
  inoremap <silent> <buffer> <F8> <C-o>:NextWordy<cr>

endfunction

" automatically initialize buffer by file type
autocmd FileType markdown,mkd,text call Prose()

" invoke manually by command for other file types
command! -nargs=0 Prose call Prose()
```

For highly-granular control, you can override _pencil_ and other configuration
settings when initializing buffers by file type:

```vim
augroup pencil
  autocmd!
  autocmd FileType markdown,mkd call pencil#init()
                            \ | call litecorrect#init()
                            \ | setl spell spl=en_us fdl=4 noru nonu nornu
                            \ | setl fdo+=search
  autocmd Filetype git,gitsendemail,*commit*,*COMMIT*
                            \   call pencil#init({'wrap': 'hard', 'textwidth': 72})
                            \ | call litecorrect#init()
                            \ | setl spell spl=en_us et sw=2 ts=2 noai
  autocmd Filetype mail         call pencil#init({'wrap': 'hard', 'textwidth': 60})
                            \ | call litecorrect#init()
                            \ | setl spell spl=en_us et sw=2 ts=2 noai nonu nornu
  autocmd Filetype html,xml     call pencil#init({'wrap': 'soft'})
                            \ | call litecorrect#init()
                            \ | setl spell spl=en_us et sw=2 ts=2
augroup END
```

Configurable options for `pencil#init()` include: `autoformat`,
`concealcursor`, `conceallevel`, `cursorwrap`, `joinspaces`, `textwidth`,
and `wrap`. These are detailed above.

### Autoformat manual control

_The ‘autoformat’ feature affects `HardPencil` (hard line break) mode
only._

To suspend autoformat for the next Insert, see above.

When you need to manually enable/disable autoformat for the current
buffer, you can do so with a command:

* `PFormat` - enable autoformat for buffer (can still be disabled via blacklisting)
* `PFormatOff` - disable autoformat for buffer
* `PFormatToggle` - toggle to enable if disabled, etc.

You can map a key in your `.vimrc` to toggle Vim’s autoformat:

```vim
noremap <silent> <F7> :<C-u>PFormatToggle<cr>
inoremap <silent> <F7> <C-o>:PFormatToggle<cr>
```

### Autoformat blacklisting (and whitelisting)

_The ‘autoformat’ feature affects `HardPencil` (hard line break) mode
only._

When editing formatted text, such as a table or code block, Vim’s
autoformat will wreak havoc with the formatting. In these cases you will
want autoformat suspended for the duration of the Insert.

When entering Insert mode, _pencil_ will determine the highlight group at
the cursor position. If that group has been blacklisted, _pencil_ will
suspend autoformat for the Insert. For example, if editing a buffer of
type ‘markdown’, autoformat will be suspended if you invoke Insert mode
from inside a `markdownFencedCodeBlock` highlight group.

Blacklists are now declared by file type. The default blacklists (and
whitelists) are declared in the `plugin/pencil.vim` module. Here’s an
excerpt showing the configuration for the ‘markdown’ file type:

```vim
  let g:pencil#autoformat_config = {
        \   'markdown': {
        \     'black': [
        \       'htmlH[0-9]',
        \       'markdown(Code|H[0-9]|Url|IdDeclaration|Link|Rule|Highlight[A-Za-z0-9]+)',
        \       'markdown(FencedCodeBlock|InlineCode)',
        \       'mkd(Code|Rule|Delimiter|Link|ListItem|IndentCode)',
        \       'mmdTable[A-Za-z0-9]*',
        \     ],
        \     'white': [
        \      'markdown(Code|Link)',
        \     ],
        \   },
        [snip]
        \ }
```

The whitelist will override the blacklist and enable Vim’s autoformat if
text that would normally be blacklisted doesn’t dominate the entire line.
This allows autoformat to work with `inline` code and links.

### Auto-detecting wrap mode

If you didn’t explicitly specify a wrap mode during initialization,
_pencil_ will attempt to detect it.

It will first look for a `textwidth` (or `tw`) specified in a modeline.
Failing that, _pencil_ will then sample lines from the start of the
buffer.

#### Detect via modeline

Will the wrap mode be detected accurately? Maybe. But you can improve its
chances by giving _pencil_ an explicit hint.

At the bottom of this document is a odd-looking code:

```html
<!-- vim: set tw=73 :-->
```

This is an **optional** ‘modeline’ that tells Vim to run the following
command upon loading the file into a buffer:

```vim
:set textwidth=73
```

It tells _pencil_ to assume hard line breaks, regardless of whether or
not soft line wrap is the default editing mode for buffers of type
‘markdown’.

You explicitly specify soft wrap mode by specifying a textwidth of `0`:

```html
<!-- vim: set tw=0 :-->
```

Note that if the modelines feature is disabled (such as for security
reasons) the textwidth will still be set by this plugin.

#### Detect via sampling

If no modeline with a textwidth is found, _pencil_ will sample the
initial lines from the buffer, looking for those excessively-long.

There are two settings you can add to your `.vimrc` to tweak this behavior.

The maximum number of lines to sample from the start of the buffer:

```vim
let g:pencil#softDetectSample = 20
```

Set that value to `0` to disable detection via line sampling.

When the number of bytes on a sampled line per exceeds this next value,
then _pencil_ assumes soft line wrap.

```vim
let g:pencil#softDetectThreshold = 130
```

If no such lines found, _pencil_ falls back to the default wrap mode.

Alternatives to Tim Pope’s syntax highlighting include:

* [plasticboy/vim-markdown][pvm]
* [gabrielelana/vim-markdown][gvm]

Note that the plasticboy and gabrielelana plugins may incorrectly
reformat bulleted lists when Vim’s autoformat is active in _pencil_’s
HardPencil mode.
